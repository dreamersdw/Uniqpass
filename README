Uniqpass is a chrome extension helping you to generate security passwords for each
sites. What you have to remember is only the master password.

The algorithm for generating password is simple but reliable. You are asked to
provide a master password, and the extension will concatenate it with the
domain of current website to generate a md5 hash. Then the md5 hash is
truncated to the exact length you specified, so you get the password.

You can click "Fill forms" button or use shortcut (default is Alt+X) to fill
all password fields on current webpage with generated password.
